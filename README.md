# Mario-Lvl-1-in-Python-and-Pygame

Level One of the popular Retro Game Mario

This isn't my work and I haven't changed anything. 

When I started to learn Python I looked everywhere for a version of this retro game,
that I could see at code level - to better my understanding. Theres a LOT of different versions out there, some unfinished but this one 
works well on my Raspberry Pi (Raspbian), Ubuntu Linux, and my Windows PC (has .exe file to run).

I wanted to make this easy to access across devices
