# Mario-Lvl-1-in-Python-and-Pygame

Level One of the popular Retro Game Mario

When I started to learn Python and coding I looked everywhere for a version of this retro game,that I could see at code level - 
to better my understanding of programming, game development and the level of work that goes into writing a game. 
Theres a LOT of different versions out there, some unfinished but this one works well on my Raspberry Pi (Raspbian), 
Ubuntu Linux, and my Windows PC (has .exe file to run).

Amazing insight to game-dev, this game was the first complex game I saw in code format, having this to play around with greatly boosted 
my understanding of building a game from the ground up. I spent about 2 days just copying out code - I refused to play it until I had it
copied and running. Why you ask? because I had a lack of educational guidance at the time, so I just typed out code, and before long I 
could understand syntax layout and errors before knowing what the code meant...this proved to be a valuable skill later on.

I wanted to make this easily accessible across my different devices

If you clone this and want to play it, keep everything in it's root folder and run: "mario_level_1.py" 

For Windows systems, run: "mario_level_1.exe"

Enjoy
